## How to use
Might be a bit hard to follow if you aren't used to this kind of thing... Sorry

1. Fork this repo, and download your forked version onto your pc.
2. Go into the cloned/downloaded repo directory
3. Run ```npm install``` and the following commands in the command line while in the directory.
4. Run ```npm run serve``` to see your changes in real time
5. Open and Edit ``App.vue`` in the src folder

You can easily find and edit these lines.

6. Change/Add/Delete Link, Open ``Header.vue`` in the components folder

Now I realize this might look scary, but just follow the structure, make sure to not forget the ',' and use mine as a reference. 

7. Finally! Once you're all done with that you can run the commands while in the ``SimpStart`` directory. 
* git add -A
* git commit -m 'My finished version' 
* git push

8. Deployment, and the rest is your browser settings. 
* Head over to <a href='https://www.netlify.com/'> Netlify </a> login with github, and create a new site. Click on github, go to your forked repo, and for the build command include. ``npm run build`` and for the directory type ``dist`` 
### Goodluck
